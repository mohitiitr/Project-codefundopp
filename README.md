predicting disasters.... 
My idea is to first get maps from Geographical research sources , these maps will contain information about the variation of factors like rainfall , groundwater levels, type of soil,average climatic conditions(wind speed,tempratures,Humidity), volcanic activity... etc The next step would be to superimpose theese maps and create zones where certain factors overlap for eg: if in a particular are there are many permanent water bodies and the area also recieves high rainfall the area would be marked as a flood prone area. Now depending upon the user's current location the user would recieve a personalized feed which lists precautions and measures that can be taken in case a natural disaster (which is more likely to happen in that area) occurs. This way people wold be prepared and greater awareness would be spread among people. since the application would use gps instead of internet the only requirement would be a gps enabled device .
